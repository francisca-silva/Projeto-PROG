ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
We added a new class called Gate which contains the exits positions and sets the game victory and a "functions.hpp" file that contais all the auxiliar functions used so they can be used by the main().
Besides that, the user is able to play many games(any maze) without having to stop the program.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
We think we accomplished all the proposed objectives. The code is divided to be easily understood in a modular way.

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
In general, we thought it wasn't very hard to addapt the previous code to Object Oriented Programming. However, our last project had errors when writing the scoreboard, so this time we tried to fix them. We spent a lot of time trying to find the problem, but eventually we got there.
